# TEX

TEX is a DeFi trading platform for de-centric exchanges and de-centralized mining. 
A decentralized digital asset trading platform is being built that includes digital assets, 
digital currency trading, and big data transfer. 
The platform is co-sponsored by the TEX Geek Tribe around the world, with a centered organization and open source code on github. 
In today's booming high-tech, TEX is not only a digital currency exchange, but also a trading hub for digital assets, a value router in the digital economy era.

TEX will be a one-stop guarantee of user data, assets, transactions and authentication 
and other aspects of the security and privacy, while asset management, data analysis, 
asset transactions and a series of value services aggregated in TEX's landing applications, 
breaking the traditional trading platform barriers.

TEX will achieve complete decentralization, with no central control. Currency listings, transactions, and asset access are all non-centralized, 
and all transaction records are recorded on the public ledger. They are open, transparent, traceable and cannot be tampered with, 
subverting traditional stock exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE) and traditional Digital currency centralized exchanges (Huobi, Binance). 
The bottom layer uses the latest cross-chain and side-chain integration methods to seamlessly access various digital assets for transactions. 
Using the POS+DPBFT combined consensus algorithm, the consensus ledger record can be completed in as fast as 1s, and the TPS is as high as one million.
